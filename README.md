### Hello Professor,

I have had a little more time this week so here is a README file instead of a long form comment with my submission!

## Assignment Notes

While having more time, I must admit it has been a more labored experience preparing this assignment as I was assaulted the other night and my thumb was broken in the process. This made typing out my assignment a more lengthy task than I am used to, especially when using my trackball mouse that I have come to depend on in my present work flow.

None the less the assignment submitted here is as usual styled according to my specific tastes, using the color pallette that Bootstrap (and subsequently Twitter) use as I remember these color combinations and like the tones.

I did appreciate the css provided with the `Student Files` offered by the textbook and attempted to retain the spirit of the interface for purposes of the assignment.

I included the assignment's suggestion of strict mode despite it being functionally useless, simply as a means of following the instructions as precisely as possible.

As is my general tendency, I have included fonts from Google Fonts, which is an excellent resource for including fonts without needing to bundle them in the program or use the defaults. I have also come to appreciate the application `Prettier`, which formats code rather easily. While opinionated, I find I tend to agree with its formulation and it works well on everyting from HTML5 to CSS to JS and even React. If you have node.js installed its easily obtained via `npm i -g prettier` and deployed (within the same directory) with the command `prettier --write *`

## Ancillary Notes

As for the incident that rendered my right hand in caste, it occurred in the parking lot of the hotel I have been living at with my girlfriend in Pleasanton and began as a botched robbery. Being probably a little too proud, I engaged my assailant in an altercation that while leaving me bruised and with a broken thumb successfully convinced my assailant to flee the scene.

And so far I think all is well regarding the class but I will be sure to let you know if something comes up.

## Thank you for your time,

### Thomas Leon Highbaugh
